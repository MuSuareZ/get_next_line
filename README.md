# get_next_line

This function was created in order to make it easier to read any content from a file line by line.

# How to use it?

> git clone "my repo URL" "your folder path"

You must go inside the libft folder: 
> cd libft/

and type: 
> make

This will compile my library with useful C functions and create a libft.a file in order to use get_next_line function.
Now you can go back to your folder:
> cd ..

In order to compile and test the function, you must type:
> gcc get_next_line.c main.c libft/libft.a

This should create an executable file called **a.out**

In order to run the executable, type:
> ./a.out <file name you would like to display line by line>
